 * @class SaleItem
 * @brief Abstract Component class in the Decorator pattern representing items for sale
 *
 * This class defines the interface for all sale items in the nursery system.
 * It serves as the base component that can be decorated with additional features
 * such as reinforced pots, gift wrapping, and message cards.
 *
 * The Decorator pattern allows dynamic addition of responsibilities to sale items
 * without modifying the core SaleItem interface or its concrete implementations.
