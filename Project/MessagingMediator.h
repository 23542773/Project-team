/**
 * @class MessagingMediator
 * @brief Abstract Mediator class in the Mediator pattern for inter-colleague communication
 *
 * This class defines the interface for mediating communication between Colleague objects
 * in the nursery system. It implements the Mediator pattern by providing a centralized
 * point of communication that decouples colleagues from each other.
 *
 * The mediator encapsulates how colleagues interact, allowing communication logic and
 * business rules to be centralized rather than distributed across colleague objects.
