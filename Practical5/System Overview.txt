Strategy

Currently implements a watering strategy based on the biome the plant originates from


State

Models the general lifecycle of the plant, certain conditions triggered will advance state, wilting is backwards compatible with mature


Command

Invoker - Staff
Recievers - Plant (WaterCommand | FertilizerCommand), Inventory Service (Restock Command), Sales Service (Purchase Command)


Abstract Factory

Creation of Pot and SoilMix families
Creates certain Pot and SoilMix subtypes based on the biome related to the factory
createPlant() combines factory methods and injects state, strategy and flyweight into the Plant


Builder

Uses the abstract factory to create variable parts of the Product (CustomPlantPackage)
The facade asks the builder to create a package with the factory when the customer wants to customize a plant


Iterator

Used to iterate through Plant Beds or Plant Greenhouses


Flyweight

Avoids duplication the species/environment preset across plants by having them in a preset pool
SpeciesKey is a small class used to identify presets in the map and is not a participant of Flyweight Design Pattern
CarePresets is a small class used to set preset values for varying Fleighweights and is not a participant of Flyweight Design Pattern


Facade

Acts as the single entry point for the UI
Communicates through various subsystems
Defines the interactions of the user


Observer

Plant, InventoryService, Sales Service are the Concrete Subjects to be observed
Plant is being observed for lifecycle and health changes
Inventory Service is being observed for restocking and availability
Sales Service is being observed for order status changes to notify customers

NurseryHub and StaffDashboard are the Concrete Observers 
The events (PlantEvent, StockEvent, OrderEvent) are used by the subjects to signal to the observers when action needs to take place
For example: If a Plant mutates from the onTick() method a PlantEvent is fired by Plant, if the Plant has fully matured then the observer can then call markReady to mark said plant as ready for sale


Mediator

NurseryHub acts as the concrete mediator
SalesService and StaffService are concrete colleagues (InventoryService will probably get added too)
The mediator has a list of StaffDashboards to notify about order assignments

The current issue with the mediator is that mediators typically hold lists of concretesubjects, this mediator simply has singular pointers/references to each concrete colleague for communication
