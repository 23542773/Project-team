FACADE PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION
TODO

1. Overview

Double facade

The system uses TWO concrete facades inheriting from an abstract base:
NurseryFacade has CustomerNurseryFacade and StaffNurseryFacade as derivatives.

NurseryFacade:
# catalog           
# inv               
# sales             
+ isValid()
//and deconstructors

CustomerNurseryFacade:
# factory               
# director                 
+ browseAvailable()        
+ getPlantDetails()        
+ buildDefaultPackage()   
+ orderReceipt()          
+ placeOrder()            
+ isValid()  
//and deconstructors

StaffNurseryFacade:
+ restock()                  
+ getReadyForSale()          
+ isAvailableForPurchase()   
+ validateStock()            
+ getInventorySummary()      
+ isValid()                  

Decided to do a common interface because seperate facades for both Customer and Staff seemed to be a better decision for us
-helps us reduce duplicates from having 2 seperate facades.

Decided 2 seperate facades because customers wouldnt need all the staff operations

Base class holds some shared vars: 
catalog, inv, sales (protected for now)

Todo implementation:
-all methods need implementation
-nursery base validations
-nursery base constuctor
-error handling
